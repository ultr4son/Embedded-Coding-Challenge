 * Objective: speed operations of malloc/free and adapt idiomatically and separate memory
             management from other data storage patterns such as linked lists, stacks,
             double buffering
   Limitations: Fixed sized memory blocks. Due to the O(1) requirement only fixed sized
                memory allocation can be performed. Memory fragmentation and
                collection/collating operations are not desired due to performance demands

  Support O(1) operation in acquire and release operations
  Strategy:
    stack object to manage memory blocks
       acquire = pop_front  (acquire block off the front/top of stack)
       release = push_back  (release block by putting on back/bottom of stack)
